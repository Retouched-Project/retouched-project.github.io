# Chunked Transfer

Large payloads that exceed a single packet's practical size are split into multiple `BMByteChunk` objects and sent sequentially. The receiver reassembles them into the original byte array.

- **Class ID**: 14
- **Channel**: 5 (Bytes)
- **Reliability**: Always reliable (TCP)

## BMByteChunk Wire Format

After the [object envelope](../serialization/object-encoding.md), a `BMByteChunk` contains:

| # | Field | Type | Description |
|---|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `setId` | UTF | Identifier grouping all chunks belonging to the same transfer. |
| 2 | `startByte` | i32 | Byte offset of this chunk within the complete payload. |
| 3 | `chunkSize` | i32 | Number of payload bytes in this chunk. |
| 4 | `totalSize` | i32 | Total size of the complete payload in bytes. |
| 5 | `byteArray` | bytes | The raw chunk data (`chunkSize` bytes). |

## Reassembly

The receiver maintains a buffer per `setId`. For each incoming chunk:

1. If `startByte` is 0 or the `setId` is new, allocate a byte array of `totalSize` bytes.
2. Copy `byteArray` into the buffer at offset `startByte`.
3. If `startByte + chunkSize == totalSize`, the transfer is complete and the assembled byte array is dispatched.

Individual chunks trigger an `onChunkReceived` callback. The final chunk triggers `onChunkSetComplete` with the fully reassembled byte array.

## Primary Use Case

The main use of chunked transfer is delivering the **control scheme XML** from the game host to the controller. The game host serializes the XML string into bytes and splits it into `BMByteChunk` objects, each sent as the `message` field of a `BMPacket` on channel 5.
